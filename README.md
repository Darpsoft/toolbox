# Toolbox Demo APP IOS / ANDROID
This application has a login system where you can enter with any email and with any password, there is no validation system.

After entering the system, you will be able to see the carousels according to the type.

The entire project is built with the best practices at the Git level, branches were created according to the features and they were merged, the commits follow a pattern with [Commit Lint,](https://commitlint.js.org/#/ "Commit Lint,") in this way it is more readable.

Several design patterns were also used in this project, such as:

> Flux 
> Custom Hooks
> Render Props
> Extendible Styles
> Compound Component
> State Reducer
> Etc
